                                  I never would have thought to buy a clown mask (it's just not my thing) but THIS clown mask is so amazing that I'm excited to finally be able to add a creepy clown to my cast of characters (and to take advantage of many people's fear of them) His name will be &quot;Gristle the Clown&quot;<br />

                                  I don't buy a lot of masks, but 3 out of the last 4 I've purchased have been from Trick or Treat Studios. I couldn't be happier with what I've received!<br />
                                  <br />

                              <p><em>Hello Chris Z,<br />
                              <br />
                              I want to take the time to say THANK YOU for all of your hard work in regards to your new Halloween 2 mask. My name is Brian and I live in Houston Texas. I just received my H2 mask this week. I must say it is an amazing mask. I will be wearing it this Halloween. I have always wanted to be The Shape for Halloween but the masks in the costume stores are always terrible and the indy masks are way out of my budget. You did a great thing in bringing price and quality together in a Michael Myers mask with such attention to detail. I can't say enough how awesome this mask is.<br />
                              <br />
                              I have been following the threads on the Trick or Treat Studios website, and Facebook. I really like the story behind the mask and how you acquired the rights to do it. I appreciate all the information, updates and pictures. I know you have met with many challenges along the way. And your customer service is outstanding. As soon as I opened the box and took the mask out of the plastic I was floored. I knew right away this would be a good Halloween. And when Halloween is over this mask will be on display with my horror movie collection.<br />
                              <br />
                              I put the mask on along with my coveralls and boots and freaked out my wife. She said I looked just like the movie. Then she wanted to play a prank on our 4 year old son. She had me stand in the closet and then she told him to go get something from the closet. He opened the door and there I stood. He looked up and when he saw me he slammed the door and ran back to his mother, yelling, &quot;Mama, the boogeyman is in there!&quot;  He soon figured out who was behind the mask and wanted to try it on.<br />
                              <br />
                              I haven't posted anything on the Trick or Treat Studios Facebook page yet. I have to scare my friend first. I know if I post something now he might see it and it will give it away. As soon as I scare my friend I'll post some fan pics. I'm thinking about doing a video short too.</em><em><br /><br />
                              I will conclude by again saying THANK YOU VERY MUCH! You and your crew do amazing work, Chris. I will certainly be back on your website to get another mask in the future. I have my eye on Chiller and DOTD Zombie too. You have a lot of good things to offer at affordable prices. I'll be telling my friends about Trick or Treat Studios.</em></p>

I think these masks are absolute winners especially in this price range and finally a worthy mass produced Halloween II mask!!

And for mass produced masks the paint and hair are stunning and the blood tears are very well done!

Also the sculpt by Justin is awesome and it's cool to see his name on the back of the mask!

I'm very happy to have these mask I my collection and hopefully I will enjoy them for the years to come.

 

 

Thank you and the whole ToTS team!! You guys are awesome!!</em>

  There is still a leper colony on Molokai with those who were the last to contract leprosy (1930's) before the cure was created. I have a friend who spent a week at that colony in high school about 20 years ago. She says there were about 80 residents at that time.<br />
