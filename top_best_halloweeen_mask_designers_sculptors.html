						    <p>Watching  horror movies with her dad as a child sparked a love of monsters and the  macabre and led her to a self directed study of special effects that  began in her teens.  Her years of experience as costume and makeup  director at a major east coast haunted attraction inspired her to start  her own business, Safari Anomalous, in 2007. </p>
						    <p>The experience exposed her  to what the Halloween/haunt industry had to offer, and she  began to develop themes and concepts that were not being widely  explored.  Inspired by a love of science and the mysterious and disturbing  qualities of the natural world, Kristen creates original and unique  masks, props, costumes, and set pieces that tend to wander far from  horror's well beaten path. <a href="best_halloween_mask_designer_kristen_phillips.html">More</a></p>

                                  <p>Born and raised in Lansing, Michigan, William Malone was inspired with film making during weekly trips to the Lucian Theater to see the latest releases of horror films.  By age 14, Malone was making home movies with a 8mm camera and designing monster masks for himself and friends to wear for Halloween.</p>
                                    <p>Malone moved to Los Angeles, California at the age 19 to become a rock and roll star, but a friend's request drew him back into mask making which led Malone to work for Don Post Studios in makeup, costume and mask making. In fact, it was Malone who designed and sculpted the mask used for the character of <strong>Michael Myers</strong> in the <strong>John Carpenter Classic, Halloween (1978)</strong>, which he used from the mold of a previous design of William Shatner Star Terk Captain Kirk. <a href="best_halloween_mask_designer_william_malone.html">More</a></p>

He is a self taught artist who wanted to make monsters since the age of four years old, after seeing Universal Studios 1931 production of <em>Frankenkenstein</em> &amp; Universal Studios 1957 biopic production of <em>Man of a Thousand Faces</em>. Casey&rsquo;s earliest inspirations were those involved in the art of makeup, used by Lon Chaney Sr., Jack Pierce, Dick Smith and Rick Baker... <em>Monster Maker </em>! As his aspirations in the field of makeup effects and the history of his beloved horror genre / industry grew, Casey soon found mentors, who urged and helped propel him to follow his dreams of becoming a monster maker. </p>
                            <p>These men, in the fields of film history, special makeup effects and mask making took the art of making monsters to a whole other level. They were Forrest J Ackerman (Famous Monsters of Filmland Magazine), Verne Langdon (Co-owner of Don Post Studios) and the Godfather of modern makeup effects Dick Smith (Godfather, Exorcist, Little Big Man). <a href="best_halloween_mask_sculptor_casey_wong.html">More</a></p>
